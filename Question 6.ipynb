    "- If we have a number which has 4 prime factors, then multiples of that number will also have the same factors. (This is simply a property of factoring. If 2 is a factor of 4, it is also a factor of all the multiples of 4, namely: 4, 8, 12, 16...)\n",

The key thing to understand is that if a `N` number has `a, b, c, d` as prime factors, then `2 * N` will also have the same primes as factors. So will `3 * N`. We can follow the pattern to get as many numbers as we want which have `a, b, c, d` as prime factors.\n",
